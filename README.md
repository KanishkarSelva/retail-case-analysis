### Insights

From this above image we can understand that the number of order placed over past years is increased.

- Sales Volume Variability: There is a wide range in the number of units sold, with the minimum at 1,215 and the maximum at 7,125. The standard deviation of approximately 1,989 units suggests significant variability in sales volume across different periods or product categories.
-	Average Sales: The average units sold across all categories and periods is approximately 3,379 units. This figure can serve as a benchmark for evaluating the performance of sales promotions or changes in strategy.
-	Customer Ratings Consistency: Customer ratings show less variability than sales volume, with a standard deviation of about 0.60. This suggests that customers' perceptions of products are relatively consistent over time.
-	Rating Extremes: The range of customer ratings is from 7.1 to 9.6, indicating that even the lowest-rated products are viewed fairly positively. However, there is still room for improvement, given that the ratings do not consistently hit the maximum (which would be 10 in most rating scales).



### Recommendations

- Investigate the Variability in Sales: Explore the factors contributing to the high variability in units sold. Determine if certain product categories or time periods (such as holidays or sales events) are driving the majority of sales, and consider focusing marketing efforts on these areas.
- Target the Lower End of Sales Volume: Identify the products or categories that are contributing to the lower end of the sales volume range and assess why they are underperforming. Consider product improvements, repackaging, bundling with more popular items, or discontinuing low-performers.
- Leverage High Customer Ratings: Use the strong customer ratings in marketing materials and product highlights. Since ratings are generally high, showcasing customer satisfaction could help attract new customers and maintain the loyalty of existing ones.
- Boost the Lower-Rated Products: For products at the lower end of the ratings scale, consider investigating the causes of customer dissatisfaction and implementing product improvements. Additionally, solicit more feedback to understand customer needs and preferences.
- Standardize Excellence: With the highest customer ratings reaching 9.6, strive to make this level of satisfaction the standard. Implement quality control measures or customer service training programs to maintain and elevate the customer experience.

### Insights:

- **Top Seller:** Fitness Gadgets emerge as the best-selling category with a total of 35,585 units sold, averaging 3,954 units per period. This indicates a strong market demand or a successful sales strategy for this category.

- **Consistent Performer:** Travel Accessories also show strong sales with the highest average units sold per period at 3,106, slightly above Designer Clothes. This suggests consistent performance across the periods analyzed.

- **Room for Growth:** Designer Clothes, while not far behind, have the lowest average units sold per period at 3,005. There may be untapped potential in this category.

### Recommendations:

- **Capitalize on the Popularity of Fitness Gadgets:** Given the high sales volume, consider expanding the range of Fitness Gadgets offered, allocate more marketing budget to this category, or explore cross-selling opportunities with other categories.

- **Seasonal or Promotional Strategies for Travel Accessories:** Investigate the periods when Travel Accessories perform best and align marketing strategies to capitalize on these peaks. Consider seasonal promotions or bundling with related categories.

- **Boost Designer Clothes Sales:** To increase sales of Designer Clothes, consider strategies such as introducing a wider variety of styles, offering personalized items, or implementing targeted marketing campaigns, especially if there are specific periods where sales dip.

- **Cross-Category Analysis:** Analyze the data further to understand if the sales of one category benefit from the performance of another. For example, do increased sales in Fitness Gadgets correlate with a rise in sales of Designer Clothes or Travel Accessories?

- **Customer Feedback:** Collect customer feedback specifically related to these categories to understand the driving factors behind the sales figures. Use this information to tailor products and marketing strategies accordingly.

### Insights:

- **Peak Season Sales:** The Oct-Dec quarters of both 2018 and 2019 show the highest sales volumes, with 23,045 and 20,060 units sold respectively. This suggests a significant seasonal impact, likely due to the holiday season.

- **Year-Over-Year Decline:** There is a noticeable decrease in sales during the Oct-Dec quarter from 2018 to 2019, which could indicate a trend that needs addressing or could be due to external factors impacting sales.

- **Mid-Year Performance:** The mid-year sales in Jul-Sep and Apr-Jun quarters are lower than the end-of-year sales, which is consistent across both years. However, there's an increase in sales from Jul-Sep 2018 to Jul-Sep 2019, which is a positive trend.

- **Start of the Year Sales:** The first quarters (Jan-Mar) of both 2018 and 2019 have the lowest sales numbers, but there's a concerning drop from 2018 to 2019.

### Recommendations:

- **Optimize Inventory for Peak Seasons:** Given the high sales in the Oct-Dec quarters, ensure adequate stock levels during this period to avoid missed sales opportunities.

- **Investigate the Decline:** Examine why there might be a decrease in sales in the Oct-Dec quarter from 2018 to 2019. Assess whether it's due to internal factors like stock issues or external factors such as market trends.

- **Promotional Strategies for Mid-Year Sales:** Develop targeted marketing and sales strategies for the mid-year quarters to boost sales during these lower-performing periods.

4. **Analyze Early Year Sales Drop:** Research the factors contributing to the lower sales at the start of the year, especially the drop from Jan-Mar 2018 to Jan-Mar 2019. This could inform adjustments in sales strategies or promotions to counteract this trend.

- **Plan for Year-Round Engagement:** Implement loyalty programs or marketing campaigns that encourage year-round customer engagement, reducing the reliance on seasonal peaks.

- **Conduct Market Analysis:** Perform a deeper market analysis to understand the competitive landscape, especially during the high-performing months, to ensure the retailer remains competitive during these critical periods.
